                Hello! My name is Edgar Camacho, and I am a Graphic Designer and Visual Artist with three years of graphic design experience and over ten years in visual arts. Currently, I attend Cab Calloway School of the Arts, where I am taking classes in digital design and visual arts. I specialize in Adobe Creative Suite and enjoy experimenting with typography and color in my work. Inspired by contemporary artists like “Banksy, and Basquiat” and the vibrant culture around me, I am focused on honing my skills and building my personal brand. I aim to create impactful designs that resonate with audiences. I hope you'll join me on my creative journey as I explore new techniques and push the boundaries of my art!
